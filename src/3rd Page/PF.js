        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>250 grams of prawns, cleaned and deveined</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons of oil (vegetable or coconut oil)</li>
          <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1-inch piece of ginger, minced</li>
          <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon of ground coriander</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon of garam masala</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
          <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><h3>Marinate the Prawns:</h3> In a mixing bowl, combine the cleaned and deveined prawns with turmeric powder, red chili powder, ground coriander, and a pinch of salt. Mix well to coat the prawns evenly. Let them marinate for about 15-20 minutes.</li>

          <li><h3>Heat Oil:</h3> In a large skillet or pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.</li>

          <li><h3>Sauté Aromatics:</h3> Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent and start to brown slightly.</li>

          <li><h3>Add Ginger, Garlic, and Green Chilies:</h3> Stir in the minced ginger, minced garlic, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears, and the mixture becomes aromatic.</li>

          <li><h3>Cook the Marinated Prawns:</h3> Add the marinated prawns to the pan. Spread them out evenly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until they turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook the prawns as they can become rubbery.</li>

          <li><h3>Season with Spices:</h3> Sprinkle garam masala and adjust the salt as needed. Toss the prawns to coat them with the spices.</li>

          <li><h3>Garnish and Serve:</h3> Garnish the prawns with fresh coriander leaves. Squeeze some lemon juice over the prawns for a refreshing tangy flavor.</li>

          <li><h3>Serve Hot:</h3> Serve the prawns fry hot as an appetizer or as a side dish with steamed rice or Indian bread (roti/naan).</li>
